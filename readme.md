# BWeird Chat Room on SwiftUI


I have been working on UIKit on Swift for along time but I had not tried SwiftUI. Recently, I've tried the framework and started appreciating the full power of SwiftUI. SwiftUI creates a lot freedom designing UI and provides app personality with great animations.

I took this opportunity to create a Chat room app which has been made as part of " Mood Tracker App " selling on Appstore. While learing the new framework, I found out that some implementation was harder than UIkit. Therefore I share hard parts like making reverse scroll view on github. After whole day research and watching a bunch of tutorials, I believe those code would be useful for some of you to try out.

## Features

- Reverse scrollView
- Image picker and save to app document
- Show image to scrollview
- callback from custom view
